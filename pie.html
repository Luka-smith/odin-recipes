    </p>

    <h2 class="secondHeader textStyle">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="recipeList">
      <li>2 cups (240g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup (2 sticks, 227g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups (250g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups (394g) fresh cherries, stemmed and pitted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="secondHeader textStyle">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="stepsList">
      <li>
        Preheat oven and prepare cake pan: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a
        10-inch springform cake pan with butter. Use your hands to dust the pan
        lightly with flour, then tap out any excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, add the flour, baking
        powder, and salt. Whisk until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the butter and sugar: In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar
        with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about
        3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Incorporate the eggs and extract: Add the eggs, one at a time, beating
        until fully incorporated after each addition. Scrape down the bowl with
        a rubber spatula halfway through. The batter should be smooth, light,
        and fluffy. If the emulsion breaks after adding the eggs and the batter
        has separated, you can add a couple tablespoons of the flour and mix
        just until it becomes smooth again. Add the almond extract and mix on
        low speed to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the dry ingredients: Beat in the flour mixture on low speed, or
        gently fold it in with a rubber spatula, just until combined and no
        streaks of flour remain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer batter to cake pan and add cherries: Transfer the batter to the
        prepared cake pan. Lightly press the pitted cherries into the batter,
        making a circular pattern. Don’t press them in too deep or the cake will
        envelop them while baking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the cake: Bake the cake for about 1 hour, or until a toothpick
        inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. The cake should be
        golden and will have risen around the whole cherries, which should still
        be visible on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool cake: Remove from the oven. Allow to cool in the pan for 10 to 15
        minutes before unmolding. Let it cool completely on a wire rack before
        serving.
      </li>
