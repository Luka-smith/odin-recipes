    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Rack of lamb is so elegant! Season rack of lamb with rosemary, thyme, and
      garlic, then slather with olive oil and roast in the oven. It’s the
      perfect recipe for entertaining and the holidays!
    </p>
    <p>
      I live for lamb chops. Juicy, tender, rare (please please give me rare),
      deep reddish pink, browned, crusty, herbed, fatty goodness. <br />

      So, when my father sent me on a mission to make rack of lamb (what? Eight
      lamb chops in a row?) I was all over it. <br />

      My version uses a simple rub with olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, fresh
      chopped rosemary and thyme. <br />

      The trick is to not go overboard with the herbs. The lamb tastes so good
      on its own. The seasoning should complement the lamb, not dominate it.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 or more Frenched lamb rib racks with 7 to 8 ribs each (1 1/4 to 2
        pounds for each rack)
      </li>
      <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Marinate the lamb: Rub rib rack(s) all over with mixture of rosemary,
        thyme, and garlic. Rub with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place
        in a thick plastic bag with olive oil. Spread oil around so that it
        coats the lamb rack(s) all over. Squeeze out as much air as you can from
        the bag and seal. Place in a container to catch any leaks. Marinate in
        the refrigerator overnight, or at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 hours
        as the lamb is coming to room temperature in the next step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring lamb to room temp: Remove the lamb from the refrigerator 1 1/2 to
        2 hours before you cook it so that it comes to room temp. If the meat is
        not at room temperature, it won't cook evenly and may still be raw
        inside while the outside is cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 450°F: Arrange the oven rack, so the lamb will be in
        the middle of the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Score the fat, sprinkle with salt and pepper, wrap bones in foil, place
        in pan fat side up: Score the fat, by making sharp shallow cuts through
        the fat, spaced about an inch apart. Rub the rack all over with more
        salt and pepper. Place the lamb rack bone side down (fat side up) on a
        roasting pan lined with foil. Wrap the exposed rib bones in a little
        foil so they don't burn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast at high heat to brown, then reduce heat to finish: Place the roast
        in the oven at 450°F for 10 minutes (longer if roasting more than one
        rack), or until the surface of the roast is nicely browned. Then, lower
        the heat to 300°F. Cook for 10 to 20 minutes longer (depending on the
        size of the lamb rack, if you are roasting more than one rack, and how
        rare or well done you want your lamb). A meat thermometer inserted into
        the thickest part of the meat should read 125°F for rare or 135°F for
        medium rare. Use a meat thermometer. Many factors can affect cooking
        time like the shape of the roast, the fat marbling, and your individual
        oven characteristics. This is too lovely and tender a roast to risk
        overcooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        C Rest the roast 15 minutes before serving: Remove from oven, cover with
        foil, and let rest for 15 minutes. Cut lamb chops away from the rack by
        slicing between the bones. Serve 2-3 chops per person.
