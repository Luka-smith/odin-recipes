        <ul class="recipeList">
          <li>
            1 or more Frenched lamb rib racks with 7 to 8 ribs each (1 1/4 to 2
            pounds for each rack)
          </li>
          <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

          <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>

        <ol class="stepsList">
          <li>
            Marinate the lamb: Rub rib rack(s) all over with mixture of
            rosemary, thyme, and garlic. Rub with salt and freshly ground black
            pepper. Place in a thick plastic bag with olive oil. Spread oil
            around so that it coats the lamb rack(s) all over. Squeeze out as
            much air as you can from the bag and seal. Place in a container to
            catch any leaks. Marinate in the refrigerator overnight, or at room
            temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 hours as the lamb is coming to room
            temperature in the next step.
          </li>

          <li>
            Bring lamb to room temp: Remove the lamb from the refrigerator 1 1/2
            to 2 hours before you cook it so that it comes to room temp. If the
            meat is not at room temperature, it won't cook evenly and may still
            be raw inside while the outside is cooked.
          </li>

          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 450°F: Arrange the oven rack, so the lamb will
            be in the middle of the oven.
          </li>
          <li>
            Score the fat, sprinkle with salt and pepper, wrap bones in foil,
            place in pan fat side up: Score the fat, by making sharp shallow
            cuts through the fat, spaced about an inch apart. Rub the rack all
            over with more salt and pepper. Place the lamb rack bone side down
            (fat side up) on a roasting pan lined with foil. Wrap the exposed
            rib bones in a little foil so they don't burn.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roast at high heat to brown, then reduce heat to finish: Place the
            roast in the oven at 450°F for 10 minutes (longer if roasting more
            than one rack), or until the surface of the roast is nicely browned.
            Then, lower the heat to 300°F. Cook for 10 to 20 minutes longer
            (depending on the size of the lamb rack, if you are roasting more
            than one rack, and how rare or well done you want your lamb). A meat
            thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat should read
            125°F for rare or 135°F for medium rare. Use a meat thermometer.
            Many factors can affect cooking time like the shape of the roast,
            the fat marbling, and your individual oven characteristics. This is
            too lovely and tender a roast to risk overcooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rest the roast 15 minutes before serving: Remove from oven, cover
            with foil, and let rest for 15 minutes. Cut lamb chops away from the
            rack by slicing between the bones. Serve 2-3 chops per person.
